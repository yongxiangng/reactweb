# Resume Web Project
This project consists of the frontend and the [backend](https://github.com/yongxiangng/DjangoWeb).
This repo is the frontend and may not render properly without the backend running and providing it with
the data.

### Frontend
The frontend is in javascript, made with react. The styling was done with css, less and some tailwind css. The UI uses the 
antd UI library. The projects and awards tabs uses the API provided by the backend to get the data.

### Backend
The backend is in python, made with django. Django is easy to set up and has an admin site which makes it
easy for me to change or update the entries in the projects/awards tabs. Click [here](https://github.com/yongxiangng/DjangoWeb)
for the repo and for more information.

### Reflections
The styling were initially done with css. However, I tried out tailwind css and it was pretty convenient and nice to use so I
just continued using it. My internship's company uses a lot of antd with less, so I wanted to try it too to become a better intern.
The styling become quite a mess but I definitely learnt a lot from using all these different ways of styling.

### What I would have done differently in future
- Choose a way to style the page and be more consistent
- Use UI library from the start and try to make it look less vanilla
